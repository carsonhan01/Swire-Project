# Swire-Project
Predictive Maintenance for Swire Coca-Cola

Project Overview

Swire Coca-Cola incurs annual losses due to unplanned machine downtimes across its production facilities. These downtimes impact the companyâ€™s ability to fulfill customer orders, and miss out on meeting portions of demand. This project's goal was to use the downtime and repair data to help minimize these losses and optimize production capacity.

Business Problem

Swire Coca-Cola operates six production plants and produces nearly 200 million cases of beverages annually. The following challenges currently hinder production efficiency:
- Unplanned Downtimes: Machines unexpectedly break down, causing production lines to halt.
- Reactive Repairs: Spare parts are ordered post-failure, delaying repairs further.
- Opportunity Costs: These inefficiencies lead to financial losses and reduced productivity.

Data Sources

Primary Dataset: Warehouse Work Orders
 - Rows: 1.4M+
 - Each row contains information about a maintancince work order.
 - Columns: 25
 - Columns range for numeric numbers about time (in minutes), date stamps, machine, warehouse information, and more.

Project Workflow

This project followed the below processes
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineerine
3. Predictive Modeling

Anticipated Outcomes
1. Reduced machine downtime.
2. Improved spare part inventory management.
3. Enhanced production planning and capacity utilization.
4. Estimated cost savings of $X million annually.

 The information found in this repository are my code and work for EDA (exploratory data analysis) and modeling. My code was writtin in R and then translated into Python for the group portions of the project. Additional detials about my team's work and presentation can be found at the link below.
